                <p>Html is used commonly by web developers to create web layout structures. You can add styling to this mark up language by adding CSS to make it change form a basic structure to a stunning and beautiful web layout. All the content should be included in the body tag and the tag to do with information of the page would go into the head tag.</p>
                <p>All Html documents must start with a document type declaration:<code>!DOCTYPE html</code></p>

                <p>Once you have statred dabbilng in Html, you will probably be more intrested in adding more power to your web . Css is the best way to do that and css is the language thats lets you apply changes to your entire page without having use lots of inline Html styles. We will go over to create an inline stlyesheet so that you can pratice your css skills, then we will move on to ten simple examples that will shwo you how to do a few basic things. From there, your imagination is the limit</p>
                <p>The cool thing about styling with css is that you do not have to specify a style every time you create an document. You can just say "all paragraphs should have this particular styling" and you are good to go. Here is an exapmle of  how one may do that. let's say you waht every paragraph (that's everything with a Html tag) on your page to be slightly larger than all. And dark grey, instead of blacy. Here is how you would do that with CSS:
                    <code>
                        p{
                            font-size: 120%;
                            color: dimgray;
                        }
                    </code>
                </p>
                <p>Okay, so now that we have seen how to make a change to every paragraphs, let us see how we can be a bit more active. Let us create a designation for paragraphs that should be in small caps. Here is how we can do that:
                    <code>
                        p.smallcaps{
                            font-variant: small-caps;
                        }
                    </code>
                </p>

        <section class="main-section" id="java_script">
            <header>Java Script</header>
            <article>
                <p>Java Script is the most in demand coding language both for front end developers and back end developers and it is useful for web designers as well as this is the language that provides functionality to your otherwise static web page.
                    <code>
                        console.log('hello'.toUpperCase());
                        // Prints 'HELLO'
                    </code>
                </p>
                <p>A variable means anything that can vary. Javascript includes variables which hold the data value and it can be changes at anytime. JS uses reserves keyword var to declare a variable. A variable nust have a unique name. You can assign a value to a variable using equal to (=) operator when you declare it or before using it.
                    <code>
                        var myName="Arya";
                        console.log(myName); // Output: Arya
                    </code>
                </p>
